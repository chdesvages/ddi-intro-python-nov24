### Installing Python

Install Python to run code on your computer:

- If you're interested in doing data science or scientific computing, install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). This will install Python, Jupyter (what we've used today), Spyder (an IDE), together with lots of useful libraries, like pandas, seaborn, and many others. Installing new packages after that is also straightforward with `conda`.
- If you just want Python (e.g. for scripting), you can also [install it directly](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Installing new packages can then be done e.g. with `pip`.

The current stable version of Python is 3.13 (released a few weeks ago). Previous versions will still be supported for a few years (see [information here about the release cycle](https://devguide.python.org/versions/)).

### Learn more about Python

- The official [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) includes a comprehensive [tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) for beginners.
- Two excellent free online books by Jake VanderPlas:
    - [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/)
    - [The Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)
- [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) is a non-profit which run regular workshops to teach Python (and other things!), for different levels of experience. All their teaching materials are open-source and [freely available online](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/), they're great to follow along for self-teaching. The [Edinburgh branch](https://edcarp.github.io/) is also quite active and holds regular workshops.

### Python for data science and scientific computing

- The pandas documentation has excellent [Getting Started tutorials](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/) and [user guides](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html). In particular, I'd recommend the tutorial ["10 minutes to Pandas"](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html).
- The seaborn documentation also has great [tutorials](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html) and a [showcase gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html).
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is a fantastic library for machine learning, it comes with lots of tools and algorithms for preprocessing, classification, regression, etc. [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/overview) is also widely used. [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) is great for deep learning as it can take advantage of parallel architectures.
- For less data-oriented scientific computing, libraries like [NumPy](https://numpy.org/learn/) and [SciPy](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/index.html) (also with a great [tutorial page](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/tutorial/index.html)) are widely used, together with [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/index.html) for plotting.
